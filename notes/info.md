1. Blockchain Use in IDPI — HIGH LEVEL

In the IDPI system, blockchain is used to maintain a tamper-proof, transparent, append-only history of:
1:Property block creation
2:Ownership registration
3:Document verification
4:Transfers between users
5:Any updates to property metadata
6:Only the hashes and essential transaction data are stored on blockchain, not the entire documents.

2. What Blockchain Stores

-  Hash of property block (SHA-256)
-  Owner User-ID (hashed / anonymized)
-  Timestamp
-  Previous block reference (to maintain chain)
-  Event type (create / transfer / update)
-  Registrar/authority digital signature

These remain off-chain for speed and cost reasons.

3. When Blockchain Is Used (Flow)

-  Step 1: User submits details + documents
The system collects:
Location
Survey info
Document set
Owner details
Other metadata
; No blockchain yet.

- Step 2: System verifies documents
Original deed
Tax receipts
Identity/KYC
Land boundaries
Mutation status
Once verified → system constructs a Property Block.
; No blockchain yet.

- Step 3: Property Block Creation
A digital block is created with:
{
  Property-ID,
  User-ID,
  GeoHash,
  Document Hashes,
  Metadata,
  Timestamp
}
Hash of this object is generated → recorded on blockchain
; Blockchain involvement starts here

- Step 4: Property Block is Linked to User
The system records the ownership on-chain:
Transaction:
  event: "CREATE_PROPERTY"
  propertyID: xxxxxx
  ownerID_hash: yyyyyy
  blockHash: sha256( property block )
  prevHash: hash of previous blockchain entry
  timestamp: t
This becomes an immutable ledger entry.

- Step 5: Future Ownership Change (Transfer)
When user A → user B:
Buyer requests transfer
Seller approves
Digital agreement generated
Both sign
System creates a NEW block:
{
  Property-ID,
  previousOwner: hashedUserA,
  newOwner: hashedUserB,
  transactionType: "TRANSFER",
  documentHash: sha256(agreement),
  timestamp
}
Hash is placed on blockchain
Block links to previous by using prevHash
; This forms the ownership chain

- Step 6: Entire Property History = On-chain Ledger
Every event generates a new blockchain entry:
Creation
Verification
Transfer
Mortgage
Release
Mutation
Correction (admin approved)
This chain becomes:
Block 1 → Block 2 → Block 3 → Block 4 → ...
Representing the entire property history.

4. Benefits for the IDPI System
- Tamper-Proof Ownership
Ownership history cannot be changed once written.
- Fraud Prevention
Fake deeds fail hash verification.
- Fully Transparent History
Anyone can trace full ownership timeline.
- Distributed Trust
Multiple government bodies run validating nodes:
State registrars
Local municipalities
Revenue departments
Central authority
- Automated Processes
Smart contracts handle:
Property transfer
Mortgage lock
Encumbrance update
Release events

5. Final Summary 

Blockchain is used to record immutable ownership events in IDPI.
Every property block, document hash, transfer event, and ownership change generates a new blockchain entry.
This creates a secure, tamper-proof, transparent ledger of property history linked to verified user identities.

Frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric or Proof-of-Authority Ethereum are suitable for permissioned government networks.
In the MVP, hash anchoring provides a lightweight alternative while still ensuring tamper detection.
